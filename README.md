Controls for Tesla was built by a Tesla owner (that's me) that wanted a convenient watch app to use with his favorite car. In this initial version it's bringing the core controls, and I'm planning to add several more features as I see fit.

## Current controls on iPhone/Apple Watch:
* Unlock/lock  
* Open/close charge port  
* Open front trunk  
* Open rear trunk  
* Start/stop climate control  

You'll also be able to monitor the state of your car's battery, door locks, charge port, and climate.

Bonus: you can change your wheels in settings (the virtual ones)

Internet (Wifi or data) access is required to perform controls. This software is in no affiliation or representation of Tesla. Please use at your own risk, as the creator does not guarantee its proper functioning. You are responsible for any changes to your car caused by using this app.
